# Alien Life

While uncommon, Alien life has been discovered several times even in the [local systems](./local-systems.md).

These creatures have wildly different characteristics at a cellular levels, and many do not even have distinct cellular structures or even organelles. Study suggests that these creatures have evolved independantly of Solar life and of each other.

However, they still bear a striking biological similarity in the broad strokes. So far all discovered life has been water and carbon based, and often use similar protien structures.

Given their similarities, its probable that many of these creatures are bio-compatible with humans. This means its plausible (however exceptionally unsafe) that nutrition can be gained by consuming them.

While many of these organisims fit the definition of animals, no alien has yet to be described as sentient. The [Sol Union](./sol.md#sol-union) maintains juristiction of categorization of alien life.

# Teegarden leeches

The first alien life discovered, these 5cm long leeches dwell in the silty shallows of [Teegarden C](./local-systems.md#teegarden-c). Its assumed that they feed on some other local organism, however they will quickly latch onto humans given the chance.

# Blade Grass Sea

Much of the [Ross 248 B](./local-systems.md#ross-248-b) planet is covered in what looks like a sea of green. On closer inspection, its a dense grass-like plant, growing up to 2 meters in height. The plant is exceptionally tough, and its edges are razor sharp.

# Rumors

Folks whisper tales of smugglers bringing in unusal cargoes from the [far systems](./far-systems.md).
