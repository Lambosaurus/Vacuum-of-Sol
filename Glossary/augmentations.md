# Augmentations

Many humans have chosen to enhance their body with implants.

Augments installed in [local-systems](./local-systems.md) come with many downsides, including:
* Infection risk
* Periodic maintence
* Distinct titanium plating and access points

Augmentation is viewed with some stigma, and it is generally associated with crime or high risk occupations.

# Jacked

A line of protruding auto-injectors start and the neck and follow the spine down. These can inject a coctail of stimulants to enhance the mental focus and reaction times of the individual.

Overuse can lead to extreme damage of the nervous system.

# Mechs

Electro-mechanical servos in the arms, legs, and back, can provide extreme burst of inhuman power. The servos and titanium rods add a distinct profile to the users.

Usage of this is primarially limited by the need to recharge the embedded fuel cells.

# Wireheads

An array of wireless transcievers and antennae installed in the skull enables interfacing with compatible remote devices.

# Sol implants

Augments using [Sol technology](./sol.md#sol-technology) tend to be extremely discrete, with only fine seams and access panels being visible.

Due to this ease of concealment, it is unknwon how common augmentation is amongst [Sol citizens](./sol.md#sol-citizenship).
