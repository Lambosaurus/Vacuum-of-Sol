# Colonies

## Life on a colony

Colonies are largly industrial affairs - corridors are are metal, and pipes run exposed across the walls and floor. The majority of the colony infrastructure is taken up with critical infrastructure, industrial machinery, and a maze of maintenance corridors.

Only a small section of a colony station are dedicated to residential or leisure - and these are usually compact and minimal. Due to the restrictions on [Sol technology](./sol.md#sol-technology), luxury goods like computers and washing machines are either repurposed industrial equipment or hand assembled. Metal filings and grease seem to get into everything - many colonists have given up trying to keep their space clean to earth standards.

Essentials goods are always in high demand, such as food, medicines, and spare parts. Colony citizens spend most of their time working to scrape together enough to get by. Not 'keeping busy' is met with extreme suspicion by most colonists - as this suggests a source of essentials other than honest labor.

Due to all colonies having wildly different day-night schedule - most citizens give up attempting to keep to routines at all. At any given time, citizens can be found working all across a colony trying to make ends meet. Colonists regularly face the existential threats of space together; in the form of hull breaches, chemical fires, and cosmic storms; and so often form a fatalistic trust of one another.

## Colony politics

Most colonies are politically independant. Colonies rely on the protection of [Sol](./sol.md) for interstellar security, and must maintain their own private security for local matters. Colonies cooperate out of sheer practicality.

Many colonies are owned by their citizens - the price of citizenship is a colony share, thus distributing the ownership and risk for the colony.

## Colony economies

Everyone uses the [Solari](./sol.md#solari) - however they tend to avoid digital transactions, preferring the guarantee of hard currency - hence trade tends to occurr in round solari. One solari usually worth ~10 days rations.

Colonies are dependant on importing basic goods like medicines, foods, and computers, and so must be continually producing and exporting goods to balance exports.

Most colonies support a few primary industries, such as cracking and refining asteroids for rare elements and fuels.

# Colony types

## Orbital

The default term for a space station in a planetary orbit is Orbital. These are the most minimal kind of colony. Orbitals are usually oriented to one or two industries, such as shipping or asteroid cracking. Most orbitals have less than 1000 permanent residents.

## Shipyard

Some orbitals feature large space docks, where large vessels can be maintained or fabricated. Hundreds of piers and cranes extend from these shipyards - workers float amongst them, assembling new ships.

## Agrodome

Large composite glass domes allow sunlight onto high density crops.
Farming in space is a difficult proposition - but the demand for food is high, and the shipping costs are low.

## Planetside
