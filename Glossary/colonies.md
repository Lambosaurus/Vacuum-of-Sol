# Colonies

## Politics

Most colonies are politically independant. Colonies rely on the protection of [Sol](./sol.md) for interstellar security, and must maintain their own private security for local matters. Colonies cooperate out of sheer practicality.

Many colonies are owned by their citizens - the price of citizenship is the cost of a single share, thus distributing the ownership and risk for the colony.

## Economy

Within a space structure the majority of the space is consumed by essentials, such as:
* Space ship maintenance
* Life support
* Industrial refineries and manufacturing

Little allowance is left for human comfort. Corridors are are metal, and pipes run exposed across the walls and floor.

Due to the restrictions on [Sol technology](./sol.md#sol-technology), the available computers and machinery are usually bulky steel devices.

To maintain essential goods such as food, medicines, and high-tech spare parts, colonies need to exchange goods and materials with [Sol traders](./sol.md#trade-permits), or larger colonies. This creates a constant demand for industries such a asteroid cracking.

Survival on a colony is difficult, aside from the usual hazards of space, basic goods are expensive, labor is hard. Most people scrape by with little hope of a better life.

# Orbital

The default term for a space station in a planetary orbit is Orbital. These are the most minimal kind of colony. Orbitals are usually oriented to one or two industries, such as shipping or asteroid cracking. Most orbitals have less than 1000 permanent residents.

## Shipyard

Some orbitals feature large space docks, where large vessels can be maintained or fabricated. Hundreds of piers and cranes extend from these shipyards - workers float amongst them, assembling new ships.

## Agrodome

Large composite glass domes allow sunlight onto high density crops.
Farming in space is a difficult proposition - but the demand for food is high, and the shipping costs are low.
