# Freelancers

Referred to as "mercenaries" by [Sol citizens](./sol.md#sol-citizenship), freelancers are extremely common in the [local systems](./local-systems.md).

Freelances provide their own equipment and ships, take responsibility for their own safety, and have a wide variety of backgrounds.

Freelancers are the most likely humans to be [augmented](./augmentations.md).

# Backgrounds

Most freelancers bring interesting skills from a prior career. Common backgrounds include:

# Asteroid Miner

While not an obvious fit - asterioid catching is long periods of travel and setup, followed by short moments of intense peril.

Miners also tend to be familar with explosives and heavy machinery.

# Pilots

A space worthy vessel is an expensive asset, making flight experience a rare and valuable commodity. Many freelancer pilots come from mundane backgrounds such as freight - but a reliable pilot will always find work.

# Enforcer

While the [Sol Armada](./sol.md#sol-armada) rigorously patrols outer space - they take no responsibility for an [orbitals](./colonies.md#orbital) internal affairs.

Many small orbitals do not have formal security, and instead rely on a few authorative and armed individuals.
 
# Scum

In far flung [orbitals](./colonies.md#orbital), the value of necessities such as food, water, and medicines, can fluctuate dramatically - and so 'acquiring' these goods can be extremely lucrative.

Many freelancers have shady backgrounds, and their old survival skills are often life saving.

# Scrapper

While often viewed as parasites - scrapping is not strictly illegal. Scrappers break down direlect ships or orbitals, harvesting their highly prized components. They are experienced in engineering, zero g maneuvers, and defending their finds.
