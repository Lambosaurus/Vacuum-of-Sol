# Machine intellegence

Machine intellegence are computers capable of not just responding to commands - but adapting to changing inputs, outputs, and goals - in real time.

While not sentient, this behavior can cause them to occasionally respond in uncanny manners.

MI's are strictly regulated by [Sol](./sol.md), and their use is reserved to coordinating military or governmental projects.

A MI is housed in an advanced supercompter weighing several tonnes, and filling a small room.
