# Shift Drive

The dimensional shift drive was the pivotal technology enabling humans to move through the stars.

It enables a vessel to escape hard-space and pass through the Abyss, taking a shortcut to its destination.
This shortcut can shorten a journey of light-years to a few light-seconds.

# Theory of operation

This drive creates a puncture in space-time, enabling a physical ship to escape our three dimensional space (known as hard space) and pass through higher dimensions.

Hard space is analogous to a crumpled sheet of paper - by leaving the paper, a long journey can be made many times shorter. The improvement in travel time is difficult to predict - and is dependant on the precise dimensional folding between two places.

The shift drive must be relatively far from gravitational fields before the shift can be made. The effects of gravity strengthen the boundaries of space time, requiring exponentially more energy to puncture.

# The space between space

Many refer to this higher dimensional space as 'the Abyss', and refer to the drive as an 'Abyss engine'.

The Abyss appears different to hard-space. A faint red glow of background radiation fills the space, and forms complex patterns concentrated around gravity wells corresponding to hard-space objects. From these patterns, navigation becomes possible.

Unfortunately straight lines do not exist in the Abyss. Space twists seemingly at random. Outside of the ships porthole you may see nothing, impossibly distant stars, or a distorted image of your own ship.

# Navigation

Due to the seemingly random shape of the Abyss, navigation becomes incredibly challenging. Most ships travel upon already mapped abyss lanes. Discovering new or shorter abyss lanes is a challenge undertaken by rigourous scientific crews, or absolute madmen.

Navigating in a random direction in the Abyss is a sure method to dissappear without a trace.

# Shift relay

The same principal is used to enable interstellar communications in mere minutes. Shift relays cannot funcition too close to massive bodies, and are frequently installed in distance system orbits.
