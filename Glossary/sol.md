# Sol

Sol is the home star of earth - marking the center of humanity.

Sol marks the center of the [local systems](./local-systems.md) - but is excluded from the definition.

Entry to Inner Sol (within the asteroid belt) is tighly regulated, and is only permitted for:
 * [Sol citizens](#sol-citizenship)
 * [Sol approved traders](#trade-permits)

# Sol Union

The Sol Union is the political union of Earth, Mars, Tycho base, and Ganymede. While each still has their internal independance - they handle interstellar affairs as a union, and Jointly operate the [Sol Armada].

The Sol Union was formed in response to the increasingly indepent actions of [local system](./local-systems.md) colonies.

# Sol technology

Since the formation of the Sol Union, technology exports from Sol have been tightly restricted. High-tech goods exported to the [local systems](./local-systems.md) are normally pre-used or refurbished hardware, often with sensitive features removed.

Machinery or [impants](./augmentations.md#sol-implants) from Sol are a highly prized find that may set up a [scrapper](./freelancers.md#scrapper) for life.

# Sol citizenship

Once assumed a right of all humanity, Citizenship in the [Sol union](#sol-union) can now only be achieved through inheritance or marriage.

Some claim that citizenship may also be granted for extreme loyalty or service.

Most Sol citizens make their home on the enormous Earth or Martian cities - and enjoy luxuries and quality of life that [colonists](./colonies.md#life-on-a-colony) can only dream about. Sol citizens often view their jobs as a hobby rather than a requirement.

# Trade permits

Some reputable traders are granted trade permits to Sol. This enables them to fly cargoes to and from the inner planets, including Earth, Mars, and the Moon.

Traders are viewed to a second-class citizen of sol.

# Solari

All trade is done in Solari - the standard sol currency. This has become the interstellar standard, as Sol guarantees the value of the Solari.

For digital trades, the solari is metered out in millisolari, or 0.001 solari. The solari is also available in a hard currency in units of one or more solari.

# Sol Armada

The Sol Armada is the largest millitary force by a a very large margin. They are comprised of hundreds of well organised ships - and patrol the [local systems](./local-systems.md) to maintain law and order.

Due to [Sol technology](#sol-technology), Sol vessels are unparalelled in their combat capabilities. Their hulls unmistakable - both their unique shapes and extreme size. Even a small Sol Destroyer commands total respect from all other [space vessels](./space-vessels.md) or [orbitals](./colonies.md#orbital) in the same system.

Since the creation of the Sol Armada, open piracy has plummeted - going from a lucrative gig to a guaranteed death sentence.

Over the past 100 years, there have been numerous reports of the Sol ships traveling between star systems faster than [known routes](./shift-drive.md#navigation).
