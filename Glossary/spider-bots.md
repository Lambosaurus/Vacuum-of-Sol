# Spider bots

Spider bots are the industrial standard in robotics. Due to this standardisation, various manufacturers spider bots can share attachements, tools, and are immediately familar to most users.

# Anatomy

A spider bot has a hemispherical body (dome facing up). The front is usually identifiable by several protruding camera domes.

Evenly spaced around the body is 4 to 8 limbs. Each limb functions as both a leg and gripper, enabling them to perform a range of tasks, even in zero g.

Often the body is fitted with additional mounts for specialty equipment, or a flat rack for carrying cargo.

Spider bots come in a range of body sizes from 20cm to 3 meters in diameter.

# Intellegence

Most spider bots contain no [machine intellegence](./machine-intellegence.md), and are simply remotely controlled by a human or remote automation system.

Some have been fitted with [class 1](./machine-intellegence.md#class-1) intellegence units for autonomous operations in difficult environment, or as a display of wealth.
