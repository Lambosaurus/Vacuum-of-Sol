Your are a rag-tag collection of [freelancers](./Glossary/freelancers.md) aboard Borisov station.

Borisov is a small [orbital](./Glossary/colonies.md#orbital) around [Kruger 60 AB 1](./Glossary/local-systems.md#kurger-60-ab-1). Its relative distance from [Sol](./Glossary/sol.md) makes it a rarely traveled location except for asteroid miners. Like all [colonies](./Glossary/colonies.md), it is an industrial environment, primarially occupied with heavy smelting equipment for processing asteroids.

'The sole regret' is the stations largest (and technically only) bar. It is a gathering point for freelancers and potential clients. Since the news of the SAS The Dame de Grace's destruction - all clients seemed to have ceased looking for jobs - they await to see what effect sol's response will have on the landscape.
