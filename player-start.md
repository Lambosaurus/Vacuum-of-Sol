# Start

Your are a rag-tag collection of [freelancers](./Glossary/freelancers.md) aboard Borisov station. You each have a unique set of skills, and most importantly, a relatively modern space suit.

## Borisov station
Borisov is a small [orbital](./Glossary/colonies.md#orbital) around [Kruger 60 AB 1](./Glossary/local-systems.md#kurger-60-ab-1). Its relative distance from [Sol](./Glossary/sol.md) makes it a rarely traveled location except for asteroid miners. The majority of the station is dominated with smelting equipment for extracting heavy elements from asteroids.

Life abord the Borisov is difficult for its citizens, [like most other colonies](./Glossary/colonies.md#life-on-a-colony).

## The Sole Regret
'The sole regret' is the stations largest (and technically only) bar. It is a gathering point for freelancers and clients. Usually its dingy tables are occupied folks describing complex jobs and negotiating rates.

Since the news of the [SAS The Dame de Grace's destruction](./timeline.md#2341---destruction-of-the-dame-de-grace) - all clients seemed to have ceased looking for jobs - they await to see what effect sol's response will have on the landscape.
