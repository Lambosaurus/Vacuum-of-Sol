# Timeline

## 1969 - Apollo 11

The first space race between the United State of America (USA) and Soviet Russa culminated in USA landing an astronaut on the moon.

This marks the start of humanities interstellar journey.

## 1998 - ISS launched

Cooperation from multiple governments on earth resulted in the construction of Internation Space Station - a permenantly crewed space station in orbit around earth.

## 2061 - Tycho lunar colony

Joint government and commercial interests began construction of Tycho lunar colony, located in the Tycho crater. This would become a staging point space vessel construction and asteroid mining.

## 2110 - Mars colony established

USA and New China's plan for a joint colony on Mars would break down, and lead to the simultanous establishment of two mars colonies.

 * The 58th state of USA, Tharsis
 * The Chinse colony, New Beijing

## 2114 - Formation of United Mars

Dissagreements between the colonies and the demands of their remote governements would lead the Martian colonies to declare indepdance as United Mars.

Previous obligations were replaced with lucrative trade agreements.

## 2170 - Machine Intellegence

[Machine intellegence](./glossary/machine-intellegence.md) would be developed in Japan.

This would lead to an explosion in scientific and engineering advancement.

## 2178 - Juno 38

After a string of failures, the Europe-USA coalition would succesfully test a [shift drive](./glossary/shift-drive.md) - enabling practical interstellar travel.

## 2180 - Ganymede colony

A research station was installed on Jupiters largest moon, Ganymede, as an international joint venture.

## 2198 - First interstellar colony

A space station was placed in orbit around [Alpha Centauri](./glossary/local-systems.md#alpha-centauri)-C-2 for mining of rare elements. This would be the first of many.

## 2210 - The Arlingham incident

The first instance of interstellar combat occurred when a Martian space freighter, The Arlingham, was boarded and looted by an unknown party at [Epsilon Eridani](./glossary/local-systems.md#epsilon-eridani).

## 2211 - The Epsilon Eridani massacre

The first officially recognised 'space combat' occurred when three armed merchant ships from Earth were engaged by a stolen Martian Frigate in [Epsilon Eridani](./glossary/local-systems.md#epsilon-eridani). All parties were destroyed - the event causing outrage within the Sol system.

## 2216 - The Sol Union

All bodies in the Sol System would formally unite as the [Sol Union](./glossary/sol.md#sol-union).

The [Joint Sol Armada](./glossary/sol.md#sol-armada) was formed to enforce Sol law in human star systems.

## 2220 - Sol Lockdown

The concepts of [sol citizenship](./glossary/sol.md#trade-permits) and [trade permits](./glossary/sol.md#trade-permits) were introduced as requirements to enter beyond the asteroid belt in Sol.

## 2237 - The Lalande massacre

Three frigates from the Joint Sol Armbada entered the Lalande system to act as a security guarantee during a local negotiation. After the agreement broke down, they were ambushed by 14 modified mining vessels.

All mining vessels were destroyed, along with the [Lalande B](./Glossary/local-systems.md#lalande-b) orbital, carrying some 1350 souls. The Sol Armada suffered zero casualties.

## 2275 - First alien life

The first alien life was discovered on the surface of [Teegarden C](./Glossary/local-systems.md#teegarden-c), in the form of the [Teegarden leeches](./Glossary/alien-life.md#teegarden-leeches).

## 2290 - Proxima Ameboplague

An ameboid like organism infected and killed 1103 humans in the [Proxima Centauri C](./Glossary/local-systems.md#proxima-centauri-c) orbital agrodome.

These organisms were confirmed to be of alien origin, but their source was never determined. After an investigation, a Sol vessel would destroy the site via nuclear torpedo.

## 2341 - Destruction of The Dame de Grace

The culmination of several terrorist attempts in [Lalande](./Glossary/local-systems.md#lalande), The SAS Dame-de-Grace of the Sol Armada, along with 712 souls, was destroyed by sabotage while docked at the [Lalande C](./glossary/local-systems.md#lalande-c) orbital station.

This is the first Sol Armada vessel destroyed proper in 100 years.

# 2341 - Present day

Years of tensions between Sol and the local systems seem to have boiled to the surface.

Citizens of the local systems await cautiously to see how the Sol Union will respond.
